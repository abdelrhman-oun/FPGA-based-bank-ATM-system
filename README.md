# FPGA-based-bank-ATM-system
The project aims at practicing the complete FPGA flow by implementing the core of the bank ATM on FPGA.
the project idea is creating the ATM control unit by doing a finite state machine (FSM) covering all cases and states which possible happening.
the control unit communicates with the database through the register file, also  it communicates with the screen through the LCD driver.
the control unit is connected to card sensor to sense the existence of the card ,scanner to scan the card ID and motor to pull and push the card.
the other components are used to help the control unit to perform the other ATM operations
