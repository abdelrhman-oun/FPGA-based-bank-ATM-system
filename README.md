# FPGA-based-bank-ATM-system
- The project aims at practicing the complete FPGA flow by implementing the core of the bank ATM on FPGA.
- The project idea is creating the ATM control unit by generating a finite state machine (FSM) covering all cases and states which possible happening.
- The control unit communicates with the database through the register file, also  it communicates with the screen through the LCD driver.
- The control unit is connected to card sensor to sense the existence of the card ,scanner to scan the card ID and motor to pull and push the card.
- The other components are used to help the control unit to perform the other ATM operations.
